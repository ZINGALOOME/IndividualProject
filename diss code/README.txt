The different code files were used to obtain the results that will be detailed in the final report. different variables are changed for each experiment therefore this is meant purely for reference. To replicate the results you will need to read the report. Lastly the code file which is a .py file was taken from a .ipynb file. Therefore if you would like to use this code you will need to edit it and remove some output and edit some formatting problems. The other option is to wait until a later date when I have updated the repository.
